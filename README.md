Methodology
To conduct our analysis, we followed a structured approach, which involved the following steps:

Data Collection: We obtained the operational datasets from ElectroniTech Manufacturing Co., including data on customers, employees, shipments, and financial transactions.

Data Preprocessing: Before performing the analysis, the data was cleaned to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We used Excel's functions such as pivot tables, formulas, and charts to explore the datasets for patterns and outliers.
EDA helped us understand key trends in customer behavior, employee performance, and operational inefficiencies.
Customer and Employee Data Analysis:

We conducted detailed analyses of customer purchase behaviors and employee efficiency.
We identified patterns and correlations that could help in improving sales strategies and workforce management.
Shipment Logistics Analysis:

We tracked shipment data to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks in the logistics process.
We analyzed delivery times, shipment delays, and shipment costs to optimize logistics performance.
Financial Analysis:

We examined financial transactions to ensure accurate reporting and identify potential cost-saving opportunities.
We evaluated revenue streams, identified discrepancies, and assessed overall financial health.
Dynamic Dashboard:

We developed an interactive dashboard in Excel to visualize key metrics such as sales, employee performance, shipments, and financial data.
The dashboard enables real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making.
